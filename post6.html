    <h1>[2024-06-13] synthetic data (we live in a society)</h1>
    <p>
        imagine training a language model on its own outputs, leading to a
        feedback loop which results in progressively worse performance until
        the model becomes useless
    </p>
    <p>
        except oops human society has produced essentially all of the training
        data for other humans
    </p>
    <p>
        with human civilizations we describe phenomena caused by this feedback loop
        as "culture" or "societal norms" or "the related works section of my paper"
    </p>
    <p>
        i mean sure we live in a universe so stuff's somewhat grounded in the
        actual laws of nature and whatnot
    </p>
    <p>
        and for the vast majority of human history we weren't so great at this
        whole science thing
    </p>
    <p>
        training on your own outputs is a fundamentally unstable thing
    </p>
    <p>
        from a certain perspective (i've realized recently i tend to use 'from
        a certain perspective' to preface incorrect opinions but anyway) all
        human conflicts can be chalked up to failures of this feedback loop
    </p>
    <p>
        but all scientific progress is also a result of this feedback loop
    </p>
    <p>
        this feedback loop is not an obstacle to superintelligence, but rather
        a necessary component of it
    </p>
    <p>
        imo, no real reason to study alignment before models incorporating
        these feedback loops as their main or sole data source become
        mainstream though
    </p>
    <p>
        since paradigms not based on this feedback loop like internet
        pretraining are fundamentally stable
    </p>
    <p>
        today's agi report: probably >2 years away
