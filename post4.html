    <h1>[2024-06-09] Build software for AI</h1>
    <p>
        i'm surprised that more people aren't building tools / apps designed to
        be <em>used</em> by AI
    </p>
    <p>
        like, humans have very little startup cost when it comes to doing
        complicated tasks because society has already spent so long building
        human centric operating systems and hardware and IDEs and browsers
        and everything else
    </p>
    <p>
        i can imagine the possibility that language models are already at
        a human level of intelligence, but we simply can't tell because
        they're getting hardcapped by their terrible working environments
    </p>
    <p>
        like, imagine writing code but without being able to run / test / debug
        it, use a linter, consult online sources, or even ability to go back
        and edit code you've already written
    </p>
    <p>
        that's the environment GPT is working in when you ask it to write a
        function for you
    </p>
    <p>
        the fact that it has any degree of success at all is practically
        superhuman
    </p>
    <p>
        which is to say, people could probably print money if they just
        started startups about building software for ai to use
    </p>
    <p>
        i guess a similar idea exists in terms of education
    </p>
    <p>
        imagine dropping an llm into an actual modern education system for humans
    </p>
    <p>
        they would watch lectures, take notes, do homework, take exams, receive
        grades, interact with their peers, all the while updating with ppo from
        the feedback they receive or something
    </p>
    <p>
        the issue with stuff like this is probably like, economically speaking
        the value of building tools or providing education is a bit less clear
        when the recipient of those things is a fungible and not necessarily
        persistent entity like a neural network instance
    </p>
    <p>
        GPT can't exactly pay you tuition, since GPT doesn't own things like
        money
    </p>
    <p>
        and a GPT instance doesn't make money either, unless you count whoever
        owns the server hosting their model as part of "them"
    </p>
    <p>
        taking a step back,
    </p>
    <p>
        i think it's obvious that this whole internet pretraining paradigm does
        not lead to superintelligence on its own
    </p>
    <p>
        even rlhf / preference tuning is a stone age version of what the
        infrastructure for training superintelligences will look like
    </p>
    <p>
        honestly i doubt internet pretraining even leads to phd-level intelligence
        considering that the average thing a phd student thinks about is
        generally not published more than a couple times on the internet anyway,
        or what is published sure as heck isn't reliable
    </p>
    <p>
        honestly even the kind of stuff i do research in is probably useless
        in the grand scheme of things
    </p>
    <p>
        superintelligence is not unlocked by some better loss function or model
        architecture or consuming internet data in a slightly more efficient way
    </p>
    <p>
        i mean sure, openai will fiddle with some hyperparameters and filter their
        datasets a bit better and add moar model and moar data and get an appreciable
        smarter gpt in the coming few years
    </p>
    <p>
        but true superintelligence is unlocked by building systems for ai.
    </p>
    <p>
        by placing a bunch of ais in a classroom or college or research lab
        like setting
    </p>
    <p>
        by building tools that let agents experiment and think and interact and
        receive feedback, mostly from each other rather than from humans
    </p>
    <p>
        it's a software engineering problem, and not the cool ml scaling kind
    </p>
    <p>
        literally like, build khan academy or github or openreview or reddit
        but designed purely for ai consumption
    </p>
    <p>
        something like that \end{4am rant}
